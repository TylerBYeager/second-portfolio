        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <p>My name is Tyler Brian Yeager. I am 28 years old and currently living in the East Bay area while enrolled with UC Berkeley's fulltime Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. 
           My degree is in Anthropology as I had originally planned to take my career towards archaeology. While that is still very  much a passion for me, I found myself taking a different career path
           and, for the last three years, have worked as a Park Ranger for the Bureau of Land Management. My experience as a ranger was incredible as I was given an amazing opportunity
           to see new places and meet individuals of different background. However, since moving to this area I have found myself increasingly more interested in the world of software development and, for nearly a month and a half,
           have been emersed in the most intense educational program I think I have ever done. Each project is a challenge that I welcome and I look forward to learning more and working for a great company very soon.
